# Boolean

- Booleans have type `bool` and can be either `true` or `false`.
- Operations:
  1. `&&` logical AND
  2. `||` logical OR
  3. `!` logical NOT
  4. `<=`, `>=`, `<`, `>`
  5. `==` physical equal compares data structures deeply (can be expensive operation)
  6. `===` referential equality
  7. `!=` physical inequality
  8. `!==` referential unequality
- BuckleScript provides binding to JS true/false but its different fron true/false in oCaml.
