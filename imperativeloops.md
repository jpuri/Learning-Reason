# Imperative Loops

- For Loops - for loops iterate from start value (includeing it) up to end value.
```
for(myBinding in startValue to endvalue) {
  /** rest of code here */
};
```

- For loop can be made to iterate in opposite direction by using `downTo`.
```
for(x in start downTo end) {
  /** test of code here */
}
```
- while loop executes till expression is true.
```
while (testCondition) {
  statements
}
```
- `map, filter, reduce` are preferable over imperative loops.
